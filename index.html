    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This project seeks to improve the analysis of student feedback in courses at the
  University of Minnesota, focusing on popular Computer Science classes to start. Teaching quality significantly impacts student learning and 
  by gathering data from surveys and augmenting it with sentiment-based public reviews, we aim to uncover actionable insights 
  through advanced NLP techniques. Using models like BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, we will perform sentiment analysis and 
  apply clustering techniques to capture common themes in the feedback given. Our goal is to identify critical factors beyond course content 
  that influence student satisfaction and engagement, ultimately offering data-driven recommendations to enhance teaching practices 
  and course design.</p>

<p class="sys-img"><img src="./files/teaserfig.gif" alt="imgname"></p>


<h3 id="the-timeline-and-the-highlights">Description</h3>

<p>This figure, taken from the paper written by Sujata Rani and Parteek Kumar (which was the initial inspiration behind the project), shows the basic process that we plan on using. Although our
  feedback data will come from different sources and our results will be presented differently, this is the underlying structure of the project.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction / Background / Motivation</h2>

<p>
<b>What did you try to do? What problem did you try to solve? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</b>
</p>
<p>
We wanted to come up with a way to better utilize and analyze student feedback. NLP in educational contexts is seriously lacking.
Based on a lot of the initial research that we did, we realized that this was a field where there wasn't a lot being done. We wanted to focus on
increasing student engagement in classes because this is a topic where NLP can be really useful, but it's not really being explored.
Initially, we were thinking of focusing on online learning, but realized that this required using visualization techniques and not NLP techniques.
This is why we decided to use actual student feedback data and implement a sentiment analysis instead. This way, we could really analyze how
students were feeling in a class and what was working or not working in that class. There's also a lot of data for this topic, we can look at RateMyProfessor
and the UMN SRS data, but it felt like the data wasn't being effectively used. The overall objective is to provide actionable feedback to professors
to help them improve their courses or teaching style. We want to go a little bit beyond just doing the sentiment analysis. We want to use the sentiment
analysis to create a statement/paragraph and identify key points where professors can improve.
</p>

<p>
<b>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</b>
</p>
<p>
Based on many of the papers that we read when doing our initial research and literature review, this is not something that hasn't been attempted before, but we will be approaching the
problem in a different way. One of the paper that we read implemented sentiment analysis, but used traditional machine learning algorithms instead of pre-trained models like BERT,
which is what we are proposing for our project. Using traditional machine learning algorithms limits the capabilities of the model. Using specific sentiment analysis models will make
the model much easier to finetune and improve. The BERT models will allow the model to understand the context of the review rather than analyze words literally. Current processes also rarely
go beyond the actual sentiment analysis section of the project. They come up with graphs that present feedback very generally, but they don't seem to really dive into the potential
use cases of the sentiment analysis for education. We want to take it a step further and talk to professors to understand how the tool could actually help them make
more tangible impacts/changes in their teaching.
<p>
<b>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</b>
</p>
<p>
If the project is successful, the biggest difference will be for educators. As we mentioned, the point of the project is not just to do the sentiment analysis, but to provide an actual
tool that professors can use to improve their teaching. This comes in a variety of ways, using graphs, word clouds, and model-generated feedback which can condense the larger text into
key points to analyze the main areas of improvement (or what a professor is doing well and should continue to do). Although we're starting with CS professors, we're hoping that this tool
can be implemented throughout various departments. Right now, there are a lot of forms of professor feedback, including SRS data, RateMyProfessor, and even personal surveys that the professors
themselves send out. The different platforms can be overwhelming. A single professor can have multiple classes with hundreds of students and understanding exactly what they can improve on can
be difficult to identify. By implementing this sentiment analysis model, we're hoping to condense the data down so that the instructors receive actionable items rather than pages of text that
may be difficult to sort through on their own. Really it's a tool that they can use. Since we'll be talking to instructors to understand what would be most useful to them, the tool will
be curated for them specifically rather than be a general sentiment analysis model.

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

<p>
<b>What did you do exactly? How did you solve the problem? Why did you think it would be successful? Is anything new in your approach?</b>
</p>

<p>
IN PROGRESS.
</p>

<p>
<b>What problems did you anticipate? What problems did you encounter? Did the very first thing you tried work?</b>
</p>

<p>
One problem that we anticipated is having access to data. One of the most helpful datasets here would be the SRS data that the University
collects on professors. We weren't sure if professors would allow us to access this data (or if they were even allowed to due to University
policy), or if professors would allow us to send out our own surveys to collect feedback data. Seeing as educational feedback comments
are a core part of our project, it was really important that we somehow find or create the data that we needed.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="midterm">Midterm OH Progress</h2>

<p>
<b>Progress</b>
</p>
<p>
We decided to  slightly update our project so that we're not only focusing on
introductory CS courses. In our initial project, we mentioned focusing on these
base-level courses to improve them, but the overall goal of the project is to be
able to use it on any class/professor to provide useful and actionable feedback,
so we decided to start with classes that we're in. This will help us build the model,
whoch can then be adapted for all kinds of courses.
<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Questions</b>
</p>

<p>
The RateMyProfessor Code of Conduct does mention that web "scraping" isn't
allowed (without prior permission anyways). Is it ok to use it for this project?
<p>
Is there any way to access SRS data from the University for the classes that
we're focusing on?
<p>
Are we allowed to use code that was already constructed for some parts of our project?
For example, there is some code online for the RateMyProfessor web scraping. Could we repurpose
that, with attribution, to take care of that part of the data collection?
</p>

<p>
<b>Plan for the Future</b>
</p>
  
<p>
Step 1: Complete Data Collection & Cleaning. Based off of the answers that we get from OH
about the SRS data and using RMP, we'll clean up the data to make it easy for the
sentiment analysis model to read and use it. This will include making sure the class
name, professor, and feedback is listed for each class. For different platforms, we'll also focus
on different things (like RMP provides some other measures including difficulty), which the SRS may label
differently or not have at all. Our survey was designed to align with these different measures
as closely as possible.
(Done by: Nov. 11)
<p>
Step 2: Create Sentiment Analysis Model. Using the different pre-trained BERT models that we mentioned,
we want to create the best possible sentiment analysis model. We will also need to implement clustering, again
by testing out different clustering methods and finding which is best, to clump together
common themes in the feedback that's given by students. We'll focus on the sentiment analysis first
to see what themes can be pulled from that, then implement the clustering to look for specific words.
(Done by: Nov. 20)
<p>
Step 3: Visualize using Graphical Representations. Once we finalize the sentiment analysis model and clustering,
we want to focus on how we will visualize it. We have some intial ideas, including graphs and word clouds,
so we will start here. However, since the point of the project is to help professors understand the feedback that they're given
and implement it, we will present the visualizations to different professors to see how it can be improved.
We then need to implement the given feedback for our finalized visualizations.
(Done by: Nov. 27)
<p>
Step 4: Final Poster & Project Report. Our overall goal is to complete the project by Thanksgiving break. Then we can
use the break to create the poster and start the report, and finish up the report once our final
presentation is complete.
(Done by: Dec. 3 & Dec. 12)
